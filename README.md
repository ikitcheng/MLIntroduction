# Introduction to Machine Learning
A crash course in Machine Learning (ML) to introduce different learning algorithms with a focus on the practical considerations of constructing a ML solution.

The course notes are in `MLCrashCourseNotes.pdf`. To apply the concepts from the course notes, go through an example ML project on housing prices in California, which you can find in `HousingPriceProject.ipynb`, with exercises and their solutions at the end.

## Installation
You can either use Google Colab to run Juypter Notebooks online using Google's GPUs with no configuration required or run Juypter Notebooks locally with Anaconda.

### Google Colab
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ava-lee/MLIntroduction)

If you plan on saving the changes that you've made to the notebooks, save a copy to Drive or GitHub after you've opened the notebook. 

### Anaconda
Install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/.

If you need to install Python 3 on Mac OS X, follow the instructions on https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/.

If you want to save the changes to the notebooks locally, fork the project in GitHub, and `git clone` your repo.
